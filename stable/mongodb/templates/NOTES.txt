Notes for the MongoDB deployment using KubeDB.

There are three primary ways of accessing the deployed MongoDB database.

First, one can access the terminal of the MongoDB pod deployed via the
OpenShift portal. The credentials may also be retrieved from the UI
via the Administrator View -> Workloads -> Secrets.

Second, the password may be retrieved from the command for use after exec'ing
into the pod. These commands would be somilar to:

  oc get secrets {{ include "mongodb.fullname" . }}-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -D ; echo
  oc exec -it {{ include "mongodb.fullname" . }}-0 bash

Finally, if the Mongo client is installed locally on your workstation, use
port forwarding to connect to the database port using the password retrived
as in one of the other two methods. The port forward command used would be
similar to:
  oc port-forward svc/{{ include "mongodb.fullname" . }} 27017:27017

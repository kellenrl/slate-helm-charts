# Deploy Basic Applications

This Helm chart is designed to be used as the quickest way to get an application
up and running on Slate.

This chart can be deployed from the Developer Catalog and has options for deploying single
image applications and integrating them into the NCCS environment.

This chart works best with an upstream image that has specific deployment parameters,
if an image needs to be built then consult Slate documentation to determine the
best path forward.
